membrane.js Feature TODO List
======================

# Current
- [ ] rename rule parameters: reactants --> products
- [ ] multiple membrane depth

# Future
- [ ] dissolution rule
- [ ] elementary division rule
- [ ] nonelementary division rule
- [ ] global rule set
- [ ] rule/membrane labels
- [ ] rule/membrane charges

- [ ] d3 run visualization

# Far Future / Potentially Never
- [ ] add priority to rules
- [ ] promoter rules (must match set in membrane for reactants to be utilized)
- [ ] inhibitor rules (these must not match set in membrane for reactants to be utilized)
- [ ] add spatial membrane system
